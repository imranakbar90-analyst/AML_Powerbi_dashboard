# 🏦 Synthetic Transaction Monitoring Dashboard (AML)

This Power BI project visualizes synthetic financial transactions to identify potential **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** risks.  
It is based on the [Synthetic Transaction Monitoring Dataset (AML)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkanoztas/synthetic-transaction-monitoring-dataset-aml) from Kaggle.

---

## 📊 **Project Overview**

The goal of this dashboard is to demonstrate how AML analysts and compliance teams can use **Power BI** to monitor transactions, detect suspicious behavior, alert generation from red flags shared by the Central Bank like Large Reportable, Structuring, High Value and High Risk Geography and drill into high-risk activity such as **smurfing, large cash transactions, or high-risk geography transfers**.

---

## ⚙️ **Key Features**

### 1. **Transaction Behavior Analysis**
- Total and average transaction amount per **payment type**
- Top sender and receiver accounts by total transaction value
- Interactive pie and bar charts to explore transaction patterns

### 2. **Alert Monitoring**
- Smurfing Alerts  
- High-Risk Geography Alerts  
- Large Reportable Transactions  
- Network Linkages

### 3. **Drill-through Investigation Pages**
- **Payment Type Drillthrough:** Displays detailed transactions for different payment type 
- Includes KPIs such as Total Amount, Average Amount, and Transaction Count

### 4. **KPI Summary Cards**
- **Total Transactions**
- **Total Transaction Value**
- **Average Transaction Value**
- **High-Risk Alerts Count**

### 5. **Dynamic Filters & Slicers**
- Interactive **date and amount slicers**
- Drill-down and drill-through for transaction-level insights

## 📈 **Visuals Included**
| Visualization | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| Donut Chart | Payment Type Distribution |
| Bar Chart | Top 10 Senders / Receivers |
| Line Chart | Transaction Trends Over Time |
| KPI Cards | High-level performance metrics |
| Table | Detailed transaction data for investigation |

---

## 🧮 **DAX Measures Used**
```DAX
Total Transaction Amount = SUM('Transactions'[Amount])
Average Transaction Amount = AVERAGE('Transactions'[Amount])
Transaction Count = COUNTROWS('Transactions')
High Risk Alerts = COUNTROWS(FILTER('Transactions', 'Transactions'[HighRiskFlag] = "Yes"))

🧠 Business Insights

Certain payment types show unusually high transaction values.

A few sender accounts dominate outgoing high-value transfers.

Smurfing patterns detected via repeated small transactions under reporting threshold.

Geographic clustering highlights cross-border transfers to high-risk regions.
